### Import from server

To import photos from your server (photos you have uploaded via FTP to your server), sign in and click the add-icon on the top right. Then choose 'Import from Server'. 

### Upload and share single photos

You can upload photos directly with every FTP client into Lychee. This feature helps you to share single images quickly with others.

1. Upload an image to `uploads/import/`
2. Navigate your browser to the place where Lychee is located (e.g. `http://example.com/view.php?p=filename.png`). `filename.png` must be replaced with the filename of your uploaded file.
3. Share the link.

Lychee will import the file as an public image, delete the original (unused) file and display it in the browser. [Sample FTP configuration](http://l.electerious.com/view.php?p=13657692738813).
